## Component Architecture

Each page header gets a unique component file to ensure page-specific content:
- Home page: `PageHeaderHome.tsx`
- About page: `PageHeaderAbout.tsx`
- Services page: `PageHeaderServices.tsx`

This prevents content duplication and ensures each page has relevant messaging.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Customization

All components are in `src/components/` and can be edited directly.
Each component file is unique to prevent cross-page content conflicts.
